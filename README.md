# cse605
This is the code repository for:
Group 3 11am-12pm Friday
Janhavi Patil 
Mihir Mehta 
Shreyas Chavan 
Scott Florentino
 
Project 1 : Malloc and free in scoped memory

Stuff you might find useful:
fivm/ - the directory that has the Fiji VM, with our changes. Compile it as usual.
tools/ - the directory that has our build scripts, tests, and output. Run tests.sh to build the executables that run our tests, and benchmark.sh to run the tools to run our benchmarks.

NOTE: The scripts in the tools directory require you to se FIJI_HOME be the location of the fivm directory...so if you extracted our assignment to /home/username/cse605, FIJI_HOME would be set to /home/username/cse605/fivm
