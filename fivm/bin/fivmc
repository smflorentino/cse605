# - Code generation of options parsing and/or usage messages
# - Code generation of any of this code except by autoconf (see config.rb.in)
# - Any introduction of unnecessary "object-orientation"
# - Use of outside dependencies beyond what is standard in Ruby
# - "Gems" of any kind
# - Rewriting this into any language that isn't a scripting language
# - Rewriting this into any language whose runtime has a large footprint
# - Rewriting for any reason other than to increase portability or performance
# - Removal of any features whatsoever
# - Wrapping this script into another script, or program, or Thing
#
# This code is Complicated.  Because it has to be.  It's the harness that brings
# together a diverse set of tools to build up a fully functional compiler.
# So unless you understand it completely then don't try to Fix it.
